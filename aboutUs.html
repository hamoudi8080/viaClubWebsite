      The Vellcity Indoor Athletics Club, now often simply referred to as
      VIAClub, was founded almost a hundred years ago by legendary athlete
      Robert Sixpack, as a place for the locals to participate in various
      indoor sport activities. However, rather contradictory to the name,
      the club has consisted exclusively of an outdoor football team for the
      last 57 years.
